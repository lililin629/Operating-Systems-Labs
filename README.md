# Operating-Systems-Labs
##### This directory contains the C++ projects I created for the labs within the NYU Operating Systems class. Each lab simiulates some portion of a unix operating system using C++.

##### Each of these assignments and the included lab descriptions were created by NYU Professor Hubertus Franke.

## Lab 1: Linker
##### This lab simulated the creation of a linker to link relative memory locations of multiple modules into a single executable. [linker.cpp](linker.cpp) contains the C++ code and lab1-linker-spring23.pdf explains the assignment in detail.
****
## Lab 2: Scheduler
##### This lab simulated an operating system's thread/process scheduler using an array of different scheduling schemes. scheduler.cpp contains the C++ code and lab2-sched-spring23.pdf explains the assignment in detail.

****
## Lab 3: Virtual Memory Management
##### This lab simulated an operating system's virtual memory management unit. mmu.cpp contains the C++ code and lab3-mmu-spring23.pdf explains the assignment in detail.

****
## Lab 4: IO Scheduler
##### This lab simulated an operating system's IO scheduler of reading blocks from a disk. iosched.cpp contains the C++ code and lab4-iosched-spring23.pdf explains the assignment in detail.
