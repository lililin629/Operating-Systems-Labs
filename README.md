# Operating-Systems-Labs
### This directory contains the C++ projects I created for the labs within the NYU Operating Systems class. Each lab simiulates some portion of a unix operating system using C++.

### Each of these assignments and the included lab descriptions were created by NYU Professor Hubertus Franke.
